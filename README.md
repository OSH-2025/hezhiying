## Project Progress

| Stage | Task Details | Date | Progress | Notes |
|-------|--------------|------|----------|-------|
| Topic Selection | Discussed research direction, considered multi-processor systems, file systems, AI (deemed less relevant), past topics (lacked novelty), and embedded systems (chosen for relevance). Planned further research, next meeting on Wednesday. | March 16 | Done | |
| Topic Selection | Discussed IoT fine-grained OS design, improving starpu functionality (considered C/C++ over Rust due to limitations), and single-chip microcontroller design: run multiple programs on one chip, then N chips with N programs, finally N chips with >N programs. | March 19 | Done | |
