| Topic Selection | We had in-depth discussions around the topic of the big assignment. Firstly, we discussed the selection of underlying related content, such as multiprocessor systems or file systems, and mentioned the recently completed Linux 101 project. We believed that it could be expanded on this basis, but some people prefer the direction of combining with AI. However, after discussion, we believe that AI belongs to the application layer and is not closely related to the operating system, and we are concerned about insufficient innovation. We have continued to consider previous year's titles and repo resources, but feel that simply copying them lacks novelty. We also propose the embedded direction, believing that it can be combined with previously learned knowledge and has a stronger relevance to operating system courses. In order to better advance the project, we have decided to conduct research on the topic discussed today and have another meeting on Wednesday to discuss it. | March 16 | Done     |       |
| Topic Selection | Discussed IoT fine-grained OS design, improving StarPU functionality (considered C/C++ over Rust due to limitations), and single-chip microcontroller design: run multiple programs on one chip, then N chips with N programs, finally N chips with >N programs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | March 19 | Done     |       |
