Chromium's kernel is too large, making trimming or rewriting less effective. Combining IoT with fine-grained OS design to manage hardware resources precisely aligns well with resource scheduling on microcontrollers. We discussed MCU design aimed at running multiple programs on a single chip, then extending to N chips each running N programs, ultimately aiming to run more than N programs across N chips |       Done        | [log2](/logs/March19-meeting.md) |
